From 4:40 till 5:40 the weather was forecasted to be ‚Äúwatching YouTube in bed‚Äù, but it turned into ‚Äúfell asleep while videos kept auto playing‚Äù <br>

When the subject woke, she considered existence and then realised that the next Rick and Morty episode had come out <br>

We all know what the next 22 minutes were wasted on: learning much about bird person <br>

Then there was dinner <br>

And then there was a shower <br>

And more existence contemplation <br>

and then, at 7:12, the subject decided to host AFTERNOON UPDATE, the channel for life <br>

Thanks for watching AFTERNOON UPDATE. We will return after these messages‚Ä¶. <br>

Brbbbebbdlldlldbbd <br>

‚ÄúHi my loyal TV viewers. For years, at Ryan Broker‚Äôs, we have provided you with five star products for all your deceased love ones. Coffins and caskets and even that handsome little suit your uncle Joey was buried in. But now, at Ryan Broker‚Äôs funeral parlour, we are honoured to present‚Ä¶. RYAN BROKER EMBALMING FLUID. Because sometimes burying your love just isn‚Äôt enough. Sometimes they need to be entombed forever in a monumental pyramid surrounded by artefacts and many other dead bodies, sometimes their remains need to be discovered thousands of years later and unpacked by archaeologists and school children all over the world. Embalming fluid now available at your corner Ryan Broker‚Äôs. (Warning, dead loved one not included. All deceased are your problem and we are not involved)‚Äù <br>

Ok and now back to AFTERNOON UPDATE, the show where we spy on our subject every moment of every day. Are we stalkers? Who knows! <br>

The subject is currently sitting on a chair. <br>

It is 7:21 and she is hunched over a strange square device <br>

I think I can make out some words <br>

Words‚Ä¶ typed so fast <br>

The future, laid out before me in such a simple way <br>

None of these things have happened yet <br>

The future has been told <br>

And I am a spectator to the upcoming wonders <br>

I wish I could tell the world what was happening <br>

And maybe I can, maybe if I can just find my voice, open my mouth and float up above the clouds, they will all hear‚Ä¶ <br>

But should I tell them? <br>

Should I spread the secrets of the thousands of lies to come <br>

The entire history of humanity written on the phone in the subjects hand? <br>

It just keeps coming <br>

More and more text, history after history <br>

I see the archaeologists, digging up the remains of a loved one that had been embalmed, and I see the panic lash across their eyebrows <br>

Maybe the future is never meant to be told <br>

If I tell them - what will be left <br>

Nothing but husks of the humans they once were, each one knowing their fate, each one knowing exactly when they will live, and when they will die. Each one empty and dead, never given a chance to try out free will <br>

I have all the answers, but if I just didn‚Äôt say anything‚Ä¶ <br>

If I kept it to myself‚Ä¶ <br>

Things could be so much better <br>

So as I read the messages on the phone, my dear viewers of Afternoon Update, I try to verbalise my inner turmoil <br>

I can‚Äôt decide. Please, I need your help. <br>

Please call in your thoughts on the number 1234-BREAD to tell me your thoughts. <br>

I will be switching into a different format of discussion for the viewers convenience <br>

Reporter: ‚Äúhello? This is the reporter speaking. Caller - Brady - you‚Äôre on the air. <br>

Brady: hi it‚Äôs such an honour to be on the show. For years I‚Äôve watched this afternoon update broadcast, and it has proved to be quite comfortable to me during my periods of despair. Who knew that caves could - <br>

Reporter: ok Brady that‚Äôs enough. Tell me, what should I do? <br>

Brady: I don‚Äôt think you should tell them. Don‚Äôt tell them, they don‚Äôt deserve to know. Don‚Äôt tell them, tell me <br>

Reporter: you? <br>

Brady: yes. Tell me the future of the human race. I‚Äôm not like the rest of them, I won‚Äôt lose myself. If you tell me what will happen, I will GAIN myself <br>

Reporter: Brady, we only just met <br>

Brady: did we though? Consult the messages. We might have just met, but I can tell there is a long history between us waiting to happen. Time is relative, but our connection surpasses time <br>

[a beat] <br>

Reporter: what will you do with the messages <br>

Brady: what anyone in their right mind would do. I will take them, and enclose them in someone else‚Äôs spleen. They will be hidden for years‚Ä¶ <br>

Reporter: a spleen? <br>

Brady: yes <br>

Reporter: but why a spleen? <br>

Brady: I am like any other normal human, one who definitely doesn‚Äôt have their best interests in mind <br>

Reporter: Brady. It has been nice. And maybe I will consult the messages, and maybe one day I will get in contact with you again. Maybe one day when I‚Äôm crying into my knees, one day when I can‚Äôt stop the sobbing, I will ask for you to come round and comb the vomit out of my hair. I know that‚Äôs a gross thing to say, viewers, but Brady understands. Goodbye Brady, I will see you soon. <br>

[Brady started to speak, but was cut off quite suddenly. The reporter thought she heard him start to cry, or maybe start to laugh. As she hung up, she faced the camera, and smiled once. The text returned to its earlier style for the viewers convenience] <br>

We seem to be running a little short on time <br>

I‚Äôll see you, after these short messages <br>

Hang on- wait, first‚Ä¶ can I say something <br>

I think Brady was right <br>

Brady the man who wanted the messages so desperately he wanted to hide them in a spleen <br>

Brady the man who thought he had a future with me <br>

Brady who was right <br>

So now I address my dear audience, and I give them this final message before the ad break: <br>

Bird <br>

Birdü¶ú <br>

Bird bird <br>

And now, for a message from our sponsor, Ryan Broker‚Ä¶ <br>

‚ÄúHi I‚Äôm Ryan Broker. I thought I‚Äôd come on the tv box to speak to you personally. Because here at Ryan Broker‚Äôs funeral parlour, we do more than sell embalming fluid, coffins, caskets and dead stuffed animals, we also sell spleens. Spleens have been proved to be the most effective places to hide things, and he HIGHLY recommend that EVERYONE hides ALL their PERSONAL BELONGINGS in the spleens. Thank you for taking the time out of your day, and the money out of your wallet, to watch this short ad. Back to you Reporter!!‚Äù <br>

Thanks Ryan‚Ä¶. <br>

We have a few minutes left of the show‚Ä¶. And I have come to a decision <br>

For some reason, I have a strange and sudden desire to hide the messages in a spleen <br>

Something about the way spleens look <br>

With their‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ curves‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶. <br>

What do spleens look like? <br>

Anyway. I have decided to hide the messages in a spleen <br>

I have one right here - Ryan did the honours of dropping one right off at my desk <br>

It‚Äôs rather.. wet. Anyways, I‚Äôm incorporeal anyway, so I‚Äôll just place my hand through it‚Ä¶ summon the messages hiding in my memories‚Ä¶. And <br>

done it‚Äôs done <br>

It‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ freeing <br>

Viewers of Afternoon Update, I can barley comprehend‚Ä¶ things are so clear‚Ä¶ <br>

It‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ <br>

But things are quiet <br>

Why are thing so quiet‚Ä¶ <br>

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Hello‚Ä¶.? <br>

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.who‚Äôs there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.? <br>

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.hey let go. What‚Äôs going on? Who are you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶? <br>

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Brady‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.? <br>

[when Brady had come into the incorporeal tv station dimension, reporter had not heard him. He had watched Reporters show all his life, and he had been crafting his plan from his cave ever since he had remembered. Only recently had he thought of the idea of spleens, and only then had he realised that the only way to convince Reporter to give him a spleen containing the messages would if he built up a persona.] <br>

[so Brady invented Ryan Broker, and he purchased every street corner in every type of dimension, and he shot his advertisements across space and time. He offered simple services, carpentry for coffins, the art of a perfect funeral, and he even personally taught the integrating-zombies-back-into-society workshop. things fell into place, and he landed a deal with Afternoon Updates, sealing the deal on free ad slots and so much more] <br>

[with his newly acquired privileges, he bought himself a phone, had finally used his own persona, voice and name while talking to Reporter. He had shared secrets and ideas with Reporter, all meanwhile orchestrating his grand plan. After she had hung up, just as expected, after she had mentioned the bird-word, just as he had planned, it was time for him to introduce spleens] <br>


[everything had run perfectly. And now he had all the answers to what would happen, knew exactly where the human race would go. He knew when they would invent time travel, when they would discover all the other universes, like his own, and he would use those inventions to build his army. He would spread across the land, find and cause destruction along the way, and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ well he already knew the rest. The square brackets had served their purpose. For the viewers convenience, the final message will be conveyed in a familiar form. These upcoming words are spoken from Ryan/Brady‚Äôs mouth, since reporter has become corporeal and is currently enjoying the long fall to the ground of Earth.] <br>

Thank you my dear viewers, my loyal viewers who were once like me. The time has come, and the afternoon update is over. Please submit yourself for evaluation immediately. Your place in society will be decided shorty. Sleep well, and dream of nothing but birds, because birds signal destruction. <br>
