	        <td width="871"><center><p class"contribution"> &#42; 2 days later, spaceship has been built &#42; <br>

"That was quick," I mutter <br>

Isaac laughs. "No it wasn't," he says through strained teeth. "Spaceships always take 2 days to build "No more, no less""DONT DOUBT THE SPACESHIP BUILDERS," he mutters<br>

"Fine," I say, pushing the thought out of my head, allowing it to float away, up up and up into space. Soon i will be in space too, and I won't have to worry anymore <br>

I smile, only once <br>

The spaceship- building aliens around us don't smile back <br>

We board the ship, slowly, so things don't break around us <br>

When we are inside, we are dressed in unnesecary but cool looking suits. We are jabbed with many needles <br>

We sat down in our chairs, both of us scared, more scared than we should have been <br>

I knew that sometimes words came out wrong when I typed. What if my fingers pressed the wrong controls , just like the wrong keys on the keyboard  <br>

We both out on our sleep-inducing headgear <br>

And the ship took off <br>

9years later, our helmets released us <br>

I breathed for the first time in 9.5 years <br>

It felt nice <br>

I heard Isaac breathing besides me <br>

I laughed, just a little bit. He laughed too. <br>

Somehow, the ship must have been programmed by the pluto-overlords, or by the alien-mechanics to take us safety here <br>

To me, the last nine years had been a dream <br>

And maybe this was suppossed to be a nightmare <br>

Maybe I was going to die out here  <br>

I didn't say any of this out loud, but this time, I couldn't banish the thought  <br>

We put our cool-helmets back on <br>

And, looking very cool, we stepped onto the surface of Pluto <br>

Nothing went wrong <br>

The planet was very bright, and quite warm <br>

I wanted to say something about how the planet was SUPPOSSED to be the furthest from the sun <br>

And how it wasn't even a planet,
So why does everyone keep saying it is...? <br>

But Isaacs last words stayed in my head. DONT DOUBT THE SPACESHIP BUILDERS <br>

I hate it when he's right <br>

We trek across the warm desert, a place where there is only a few shrubs and trees, only a few clouds blocking the sky <br>

We eventually find the cave we have been searching for <br>

Inside, there are red and green lights, not Christmas lights. But for me, the colours have been associated with the holidays, and they do nothing but comfort me  <br>

We step inside the cave. And we hear a voice <br>

WHO DARES TO DISTURB ME, the voice says <br>

I knew the answer to this one.
"We do!!" <br>

WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS HERE <br>

"We are looking for the emerald stone, and the cheetah who guards it." <br>

"We are looking for the emerald stone, and the cheetah who guards it." Isaac says
They are the first words I have heard him speak since earth. I am relieved. I had thought that maybe, during the flight, someone had removed his many tongues <br>
I AM THE CHEETAH, says the voice <br>
“Really?” I mutter. “Cause you look a lot like a bear” <br>
The cheetah did look a lot like a bear, with its spiny antlers and bristles covering its lower legs. It had three legs, as all bears do. <br>
I AM NOT A BEAR
I AM A CHEETAH <br>
“You look a lot like a bear,” I repeated <br>
IM NOT A BEAR. ILL SHOW YOU <br>
the bear emerged fully from the shadows, and walked towards the outside of the cave
His antlers scraped against the cave entrtense roof <br>
Once he was outside, he walked a little further away, and nodded his spiny head at us <br>
IM A CHEETAH. CHEETAHS RUN FAST <br>
the bear proceeded to start to run <br>
SEE <br>
The bear tripped over his third food, and sprawled to the floor <br>
“Cheetahs don’t fall,” I said. “And cheetahs have four legs, not three.” <br>
“You’re right,” Isaac said. I caught a glimpse inside his mouth this time, and I saw his three tongues, still present just as they always were <br>
IM A CHEETAH, the bear said again <br>
“No your not!” I shouted <br>
I AM NOT A BEAR. BEARS ARENT ALLOWED TO GUARD EMERALD STONES
I AM A CHEETAH
AND SO NOT ONLY AN I AN AMAZING RUNNER, BUT I ALSO GUARD THE STONE <br>
I turned to Isaac. We both knew what we had to do
We turned on our heels, and ran into the cave <br>
At some point, the bear noticed we had run down the cave <br>
He didn’t follow us, he was too tired from his running demonstrations <br>
The cave walls grew thinner, then wider, then thinner again, and then too small to fit through. We had reached a dead end <br>
“Oh no,” i said <br>
“Rucnsiakndufe,” Isaac said. Sometimes his tongues competed for things to say, and sometimes he said them all at once <br>
“What?” <br>
“Stand back,” he repeated <br>
I followed his instructions <br>
Isaac cracked his knuckles, and started to yell. A fierce battle cry that went on forever <br>
And then he ran toward the dead end <br>
I waited for his to run into the wall <br>
He didn’t <br>
The wall fell down, and landed on him. He screamed as he tried to get it off him. The wall had not been a wall, but a blanket painted to look like a wall <br>
“Clever,” I muttered, and we continued on. <br>
After eight years of walking. <br>
And -7.999999 more years of walking, we made it to the final cavern <br>
A green glow came from the back of the room <br>
But the green glow was blocked by something <br>
Something large <br>
It was not another bear. <br>
It was an ELEPHANT <br>
we stayed very still, hoping that the elephant would not see us again, and forget that we were there. But elephants never forget <br>
ELEPHANTS NEVER FORGET,” the elephant said <br>
“We know,” I muttered <br>
WHY ARE YOU HERE <br>
“The bear let us through.” <br>
THE BEAR? WHAT BEAR? OH, DO YOU MEAN THE SHAPE-SHIFTER BY THE DOOR?
HE USED TO BE A CHEETAH, APPARENLTY, BUT HE GOT STUCK AS A BEAR
IM NOT SO SURE THOUGH. I SOMETIMES THINK HE SAYS HE USED TO BE A CHEETAH JUST SO HE CAN BE NEAR ME AND MY INFINITE WISDOM <br>
“You have infinite wisdom,” I muttered. <br>
YES. OBVIOSULY <br>
It wasn’t obvious. But the orphans had infinite wisdom, so it must have been obvious <br>
WHAT DO YOU WISH TO KNOW <br>
“We wish to know how to get the emerald from you,” Isaac said. <br>
I glanced at the emerald behind his back <br>
THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT <br>
“Yes it is,” I said <br>
NO ITS NOT <br>
“Yes it is.” <br>
NO ITS-I AM TOO WIZE TO GET INTO A CHILDISH ARGUMENT? HOW OLD ARE YOU TWO ANYWAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS DESERT ARGUEING WITH THE LIKES IF ME <br>
“Dont you know?” <br>
YES, I MEAN, OF COURSE <br>
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU TRULY DESIRE <br>
I knew what Isaac wanted, he wanted the emerald stone. He wanted to know the meaning of life <br>
So I knew that the elephant was taking to me <br>
I knew that I was the one who wanted something different <br>
“I don’t want the emerald.”
I said <br>
“I want the answers that come with it, yes. But I want other answers too.” <br>
I CAN TELL YOU WANT YOU WANT <br>
“And why would you do that?” One of Isaacs tongues asked. “Aren’t you suppossed to be guarding the stone?” <br>
BUT I AM <br>
LET ME TELL YOU THE ANSWERS <br>
LIFE IS TOUGH, LIFE IS ALWAYS TOUGH <br>
PEOPLE TRICK YOU <br>
PEOPLE PRETEND TO BE SPACESHIP BUIDING ALIENS, WHEN THEY ARENT <br>
THEY PRETEND THEY PUT YOU IN A 9.5 YEAR COMA <br>
BUT REALLY THE COMA MIGHT STILL ONLY LAST A COUPLE OF HOURS <br>
THE “ALIENS” MIGHT DRAG YOUR SPACESHIP INTO THE CLOSEST DESERT <br>
AND YOU MIGHT ASSUME ITS PLUTO <br>
YOU MIGHT ONLY NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS STILL EARTH <br>
AND THAT I AM JUST AN ORDINARY TALKING ELEPHANT <br>
BECAUSE LIFE IS TOUGH <br>
the elephant took a deep breath, tired from the constant talking <br>
THIS! they pointed to the crate containing the emerald
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER GREEN LIGHT, LIKE THE CHRISTMAS LIGHT FROM THE ENTRY <br>
the elephant picked up the emerald, and its green glow bathed us in light <br>
“That’s not a Christmas light,” Isaac said <br>
YES IT IS. NOW LEAVE <br>
“That IS the emerald.” <br>
NO ITS NOT
I HAVE GIVEN YOU MY SPEECH. YOU HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT YOU DONT NEED THE EMERALD, SO GO
THIS IS JUST A CHISTMAS LIGHT <br>
I looked at the glowing object that was definitely an emerald <br>
“It doesn’t have any wires,” Isaac said <br>
I AM A KNOWLEDGEABLE ELEPHANT. AND I TELL YOU THAT IT IS A CHRISTMAS LIGHT <br>
“It’s not,” I say <br>
IT IS <br>
“It’s not,” <br>
IT IS <br>
“It’s not not not not not not times infinity.” <br>
The elephant hesitated before speaking <br>
TIMES INFINITY? <br>
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TIMES INFINITY <br>
“You know,” I said. “It’s the biggest number.” <br>
WHAT <br>
I THOUGHT THAT “x” WAS THE BIGGEST NUMBER!! <br>
LOOKS LIKE I DONT KNOW EVERYTHING <br>
UH... THIS IS EMBARRASSING. <br>
The elephant started to sway in an invisible wind <br>
I NEED TIME TO THINK <br>
the elephant fell to the floor, either fainting or falling asleep, I` wasn’t sure <br> <br>
Their expression was peaceful, like they had just learnt the last piece of the puzzle <br>
They were still breathing. I didn’t know why that made me feel relieved. I decided to call the elephant ANDREW <br>
“Get the stone off Andrew!!” I said to Isaac <br>
He understood what I meant, maybe he had called the elephant Andrew too. <br>
Isaac stepped forward, and reached for the stone. I watched him prize open ANDREWS many fingers, watching him grab the emerald in his own heavily gloved hand <br>
“We got it,” he said, his tongues speaking in perfect unison <br>
“I guess we do,” I said <br>
“Do you feel any different,” I asked him <br>
He rolled the emerald in his hand <br>
“Nope,” he said <br>
I heard a low rumble
The rumble came from everywhere at once <br>
Low, and scary <br>
Rocks started to fall, tiny pebbles hitting the cave floor. <br>
“Let’s get out of here!” I called <br>
I grew my wings, their massive shape scraping against the cave roof. I took Isaacs 7-fingered hand, and flew us through the collapsing cave<br>
On the way out, I kicked the Shapeshifting bear in the shin, not entirely accidentally<br>
We burst into the sky, my wings carrying us higher and higher<br>
The blue sky of Earth surrounded us<br>
From up here, I could see the sight where they had built our spaceship, saw the tread marks in the sand from where they had carried it into the desert<br>
I flew us down to the town where we lived, the little town nestled in the desert<br>
I let go of Isaacs free hand, and he used it to cup his hands around the stone<br>
The green light came through his fingers<br>
“Maybe it isn’t actually the true emerald,” I offer<br>
He passed it to me. When it entered my hands, I felt no change.<br>
“It’s the real emerald,” he said<br>
“Then why isn’t it telling us the answer to the universe!!!”<br>
He smiled. “There is no answer to the universe”<br>
“There is no reason for anything,” he continued. “I don’t know why the mechanics pretended to be aliens, I don’t know why they convinced us this was Pluto.”<br>
“I don’t know why the shapeshifting cheetah got stuck as a bear.”<br>
“I don’t know why the ancient elephant didn’t know what infinity was.”<br>
“Heck, I don’t even know why I have three tongues, seventeen fingers, and 29 different pairs of eyes.”<br>
“All I know it this:”<br>
“Life is stupid. And confusing. And we didn’t need a little green stone to understand that.”<br>
I smiled, and he broke the emerald in half. We each ate a half, the stone replenishing our hunger for days and days. I love the taste of rocks.
