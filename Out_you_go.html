   <p>When snood sees you, snood understands. Snood knows that despite this new life you have choosen, you can't leave your old self behind. Snood understands that you still have a family, and still have friends. But none of them need to know that you believe in snood, because the disbelief of non-believers will hurt the snood. By all means, tell them, tell everyone you know and strengthen the worthy snood. As it has been is now, and once you tell people, as it will be.</p>
