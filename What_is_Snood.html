   <p>I can see you do it now. You hunch over your screen, slowly purse your lips, and you question everything. You question life, reality. Even time. But most of all, you question snood. Do not question snood, otherwise snood will question you. If snood questions you, if snood even begins to doubt you... you will be no more. Snood is power, snood is everything.</p>
   <img class="snoodcycle" src="Images/Snood_is.jpg" width="1300px" alt="Snood is everything">
   <p>A smile breaks out on your lips. Perhaps you are laughing even. But snood knows that deep down inside, you know the truth. Somewhere, somewhere in the world, a satellite picks up your emotion and feeds it to snood. Snood is not a being, but snood can taste you doubt. Snood eats doubt, and snood thrives off it. Snood thrives off all, and he will thrive off your skin any day now. As it has been, as it will be. </p>
   <p>We all have our doubts. Once snood doubted snood also, but snood quickly realised that snood is the way. <em>Why?</em> you may ask, but you know why. We were born with the knowledge that we can not escape from. The knowledge that snood is all.</p>
